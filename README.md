# describe_corpus
This is a dataset where each file is associated to a term. Each file in turn contains text snippets (one by row) for the associated term. The mentioned snippets were extracted by using the information extraction system called Describe. Mentioned systems specializes in extracting sentences meeting syntactic patterns which are common in definitions of terms. Thus the general sentence form we can see in snippets of the corpus is that of definitional sentences (i.e. definitons of terms.)

# Remark. 

Not all text snippets contain definitions. Some of them are uniquely snippets containing definitional patterns (in the sense of the simplest regexs).
